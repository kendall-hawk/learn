<p class="transcript-paragraph"><span class="speaker">Neil:</span> <span data-sentence-id="1">Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.</span></p>
<p class="transcript-paragraph"><span class="speaker">Beth:</span> <span data-sentence-id="2">And I'm Beth.</span></p>
<p class="transcript-paragraph"><span class="speaker">Neil:</span> <span data-sentence-id="3">Do you enjoy eating noodles, Beth?</span></p>
<p class="transcript-paragraph"><span class="speaker">Beth:</span> <span data-sentence-id="4">I love noodles, yes.</span> <span data-sentence-id="5">I think my favourite are udon – the big thick ones.</span> <span data-sentence-id="6">Mmm, they're so good!</span> <span data-sentence-id="7">Well, some people buy them dried in a packet,</span> <span data-sentence-id="8">others make them <span class="glossary-term" data-word="fresh" data-context="default">fresh</span> from wheat or rice,</span> <span data-sentence-id="9">but there is little doubt that noodles are <span class="glossary-term" data-word="popular" data-context="default">popular</span> around the world.</span> <span data-sentence-id="10">From their <span class="glossary-term" data-word="origins" data-context="default">origins</span>, probably somewhere in China,</span> <span data-sentence-id="11">noodle <span class="glossary-term" data-word="recipes" data-context="default">recipes</span> were <span class="glossary-term" data-word="spread" data-context="default">spread</span> by <span class="glossary-term" data-word="traders" data-context="default">traders</span> on the ancient Silk Road.</span> <span data-sentence-id="12">At each <span class="glossary-term" data-word="destination" data-context="default">destination</span> along the road, people gave noodles a twist,</span> <span data-sentence-id="13">adding different <span class="glossary-term" data-word="flavour" data-context="default">flavours</span> and <span class="glossary-term" data-word="ingredients" data-context="default">ingredients</span> to create a new dish.</span></p>
<p class="transcript-paragraph"><span class="speaker">Neil:</span> <span data-sentence-id="14">In this programme, we'll visit the United States and Japan,</span> <span data-sentence-id="15">two countries which have taken noodles and created exciting new <span class="glossary-term" data-word="varieties" data-context="default">varieties</span>.</span> <span data-sentence-id="16">As usual, we'll learn some useful new vocabulary,</span> <span data-sentence-id="17">and remember – you can read along with the transcript of this programme,</span> <span data-sentence-id="18">available now on our website, bbclearningenglish.com.</span></p>
<p class="transcript-paragraph"><span class="speaker">Beth:</span> <span data-sentence-id="19">But first, Neil, I have a question for you.</span> <span data-sentence-id="20">As well as different shapes and <span class="glossary-term" data-word="ingredients" data-context="default">ingredients</span>,</span> <span data-sentence-id="21">noodles come in many different <span class="glossary-term" data-word="flavour" data-context="default">flavours</span>.</span> <span data-sentence-id="22">So which region of China is famous for its spicy <span class="glossary-term" data-word="flavour" data-context="default">flavours</span>?</span> <span data-sentence-id="23">Is it: a) Shanghai, b) Sichuan, or c) Guangzhou?</span></p>
<p class="transcript-paragraph"><span class="speaker">Neil:</span> <span data-sentence-id="24">Well, I think actually, Beth, I know the answer to this.</span> <span data-sentence-id="25">I've been lucky enough to have been to this place.</span> <span data-sentence-id="26">I think it's b) Sichuan.</span></p>
<p class="transcript-paragraph"><span class="speaker">Beth:</span> <span data-sentence-id="27">OK. Well, you sound confident.</span> <span data-sentence-id="28">I will reveal the answer later in the programme.</span> <span data-sentence-id="29">BBC World Service programme, The Food Chain,</span> <span data-sentence-id="30"><span class="glossary-term" data-word="investigated" data-context="default">investigated</span> how noodles <span class="glossary-term" data-word="spread" data-context="default">spread</span> from Asia through Europe to America.</span> <span data-sentence-id="31">They <span class="glossary-term" data-word="uncovered" data-context="default">uncovered</span> a surprising story that pasta comes</span> <span data-sentence-id="32">from noodles brought back to Italy by Marco Polo in the 13th century.</span> <span data-sentence-id="33">Jen Lin-Liu, author of the book,</span> <span data-sentence-id="34">'On the Noodle Road', doesn't believe this story.</span></p>
<p class="transcript-paragraph"><span class="speaker">Jen Lin-Liu:</span> <span data-sentence-id="35">So, noodles were very <span class="glossary-term" data-word="exotic" data-context="default">exotic</span> in the 1920s and 30s in the United States,</span> <span data-sentence-id="36">and there was a new pasta <span class="glossary-term" data-word="association" data-context="default">association</span> in America</span> <span data-sentence-id="37">that wanted to <span class="glossary-term" data-word="promote" data-context="default">promote</span> the <span class="glossary-term" data-word="manufacturing" data-context="default">manufacturing</span> of dried pasta.</span> <span data-sentence-id="38">And so they came up with a story</span> <span data-sentence-id="39">about how Marco Polo went to China</span> <span data-sentence-id="40">and found the noodle there,</span> <span data-sentence-id="41">and brought it all the way to Italy.</span></p>
<p class="transcript-paragraph"><span class="speaker">Neil:</span> <span data-sentence-id="42">In the 1920s, noodles were <span class="glossary-term" data-word="popular" data-context="default">popular</span> because they were <span class="glossary-term" data-word="exotic" data-context="default">exotic</span>,</span> <span data-sentence-id="43"><span class="glossary-term" data-word="meaning" data-context="default">meaning</span> <span class="glossary-term" data-word="foreign" data-context="default">foreign</span>, unusual and exciting.</span> <span data-sentence-id="44">At that time pasta companies were promoting a new <span class="glossary-term" data-word="invention" data-context="default">invention</span>, dried pasta,</span> <span data-sentence-id="45">so they came up with a story about Marco Polo to sell more pasta.</span> <span data-sentence-id="46">If you come up with something you suggest or think up an idea.</span> <span data-sentence-id="47">And it worked – sales of pasta jumped as a result!</span></p>
<p class="transcript-paragraph"><span class="speaker">Beth:</span> <span data-sentence-id="48">Now, our second <span class="glossary-term" data-word="destination" data-context="default">destination</span>, Japan, also has a history of eating noodles.</span> <span data-sentence-id="49">One of the most famous Japanese noodle dishes is ramen,</span> <span data-sentence-id="50">and Frank Striegl, a blogger living in Tokyo, knows all about it.</span> <span data-sentence-id="51">He eats over 300 bowls of ramen a year!</span> <span data-sentence-id="52">He explained to BBC World Service's The Food Chain how Chinese immigrants</span> <span data-sentence-id="53">to Japan in the late 1800s influenced this Japanese dish.</span></p>
<p class="transcript-paragraph"><span class="speaker">Frank Striegl:</span> <span data-sentence-id="54">And <span class="glossary-term" data-word="at one point or another" data-context="default">at one point or another</span>, different chefs decided to <span class="glossary-term" data-word="localise" data-context="default">localise</span> these dishes.</span> <span data-sentence-id="55">They said, "We love these Chinese noodle dishes.</span> <span data-sentence-id="56">However, why don't we tweak them?</span> <span data-sentence-id="57">Why don't we make them a little bit more Japanese?"</span></p>
<p class="transcript-paragraph"><span class="speaker">Neil:</span> <span data-sentence-id="58">Frank says that <span class="glossary-term" data-word="at one point or another" data-context="default">at one point or another</span>, chefs started to make</span> <span data-sentence-id="59">noodle dishes more Japanese.</span> <span data-sentence-id="60">Here, the phrase, <span class="glossary-term" data-word="at one point or another" data-context="default">at one point or another</span>,</span> <span data-sentence-id="61">means at some <span class="glossary-term" data-word="unspecified" data-context="default">unspecified</span> time in the past.</span></p>
<p class="transcript-paragraph"><span class="speaker">Beth:</span> <span data-sentence-id="62">They did this by tweaking Chinese noodles – in other words,</span> <span data-sentence-id="63">by changing them slightly to make them better, different,</span> <span data-sentence-id="64">or in this case, more Japanese.</span></p>
<p class="transcript-paragraph"><span class="speaker">Neil:</span> <span data-sentence-id="65">By making these tweaks, adding new toppings and <span class="glossary-term" data-word="slices" data-context="default">slices</span> of beef or chicken,</span> <span data-sentence-id="66">Japanese chefs created the noodle dish we know today as ramen.</span> <span data-sentence-id="67">Here's Frank Striegl again, talking with BBC World Service's The Food Chain.</span></p>
<p class="transcript-paragraph"><span class="speaker">Frank Striegl:</span> <span data-sentence-id="68">And what I find fascinating about ramen,</span> <span data-sentence-id="69">compared to perhaps other wonderful noodle dishes around the world,</span> <span data-sentence-id="70">is that ramen continues to <span class="glossary-term" data-word="evolve" data-context="default">evolve</span>.</span> <span data-sentence-id="71">Unlike other Japanese foods, it's OK to <span class="glossary-term" data-word="push the boundaries" data-context="default">push the boundaries</span>.</span></p>
<p class="transcript-paragraph"><span class="speaker">Beth:</span> <span data-sentence-id="72">Frank thinks that Japanese ramen continues to <span class="glossary-term" data-word="evolve" data-context="default">evolve</span> –</span> <span data-sentence-id="73">to develop and change <span class="glossary-term" data-word="gradually" data-context="default">gradually</span></span> <span data-sentence-id="74">in <span class="glossary-term" data-word="response" data-context="default">response</span> to new developments and ideas.</span> <span data-sentence-id="75">Unlike other <span class="glossary-term" data-word="traditional" data-context="default">traditional</span> foods such as sushi,</span> <span data-sentence-id="76">modern versions of ramen <span class="glossary-term" data-word="push the boundaries" data-context="default">push the boundaries</span>.</span> <span data-sentence-id="77">If you <span class="glossary-term" data-word="push the boundaries" data-context="default">push the boundaries</span>,</span> <span data-sentence-id="78">you act in a way which challenges normal <span class="glossary-term" data-word="acceptable" data-context="default">acceptable</span> behaviour.</span></p>
<p class="transcript-paragraph"><span class="speaker">Neil:</span> <span data-sentence-id="79">Yes, noodles have changed so much since ancient times</span> <span data-sentence-id="80">that today you can buy them dried in a packet and simply add hot water.</span> <span data-sentence-id="81">But the <span class="glossary-term" data-word="flavour" data-context="default">flavours</span> and the noodles themselves maintain a link to the past.</span> <span data-sentence-id="82">Now, speaking of <span class="glossary-term" data-word="flavour" data-context="default">flavours</span>, what was the answer to your question, Beth?</span></p>
<p class="transcript-paragraph"><span class="speaker">Beth:</span> <span data-sentence-id="83">Well, I asked you which region of China is famous for its spicy <span class="glossary-term" data-word="flavour" data-context="default">flavours</span>.</span> <span data-sentence-id="84">You were very confident with saying Sichuan and that is the correct answer.</span> <span data-sentence-id="85">Sichuan is a place that is famous for spicy food,</span> <span data-sentence-id="86">such as the Sichuan pepper and Sichuan hotpot.</span> <span data-sentence-id="87">OK. It's time to recap the vocabulary we've learnt.</span> <span data-sentence-id="88">If you give something a twist,</span> <span data-sentence-id="89">you change it in some small way to create something new and exciting.</span></p>
<p class="transcript-paragraph"><span class="speaker">Neil:</span> <span data-sentence-id="90">The adjective <span class="glossary-term" data-word="exotic" data-context="default">exotic</span> means unusual and exciting</span> <span data-sentence-id="91">because of coming from far away.</span></p>
<p class="transcript-paragraph"><span class="speaker">Beth:</span> <span data-sentence-id="92">The phrase, <span class="glossary-term" data-word="at one point or another" data-context="default">at one point or another</span> means at some <span class="glossary-term" data-word="unspecified" data-context="default">unspecified</span> time in the past.</span></p>
<p class="transcript-paragraph"><span class="speaker">Neil:</span> <span data-sentence-id="93">If you tweak something, you alter it slightly in order to improve it.</span></p>
<p class="transcript-paragraph"><span class="speaker">Beth:</span> <span data-sentence-id="94">Something which <span class="glossary-term" data-word="evolves" data-context="default">evolves</span>, develops and changes <span class="glossary-term" data-word="gradually" data-context="default">gradually</span>.</span></p>
<p class="transcript-paragraph"><span class="speaker">Neil:</span> <span data-sentence-id="95">And finally, the <span class="glossary-term" data-word="idiom" data-context="default">idiom</span> to <span class="glossary-term" data-word="push the boundaries" data-context="default">push the boundaries</span></span> <span data-sentence-id="96">means to do things which challenge normal <span class="glossary-term" data-word="acceptable" data-context="default">acceptable</span> behaviour.</span> <span data-sentence-id="97">Once again, our six minutes are up.</span> <span data-sentence-id="98">If you enjoyed the programme, why not visit our website and check out all</span> <span data-sentence-id="99">of the different podcasts that we have at BBC Learning English.</span> <span data-sentence-id="100">There's something there for everyone.</span> <span data-sentence-id="101">Thanks for joining us and goodbye.</span></p>
