        <p class="transcript-paragraph"><span class="speaker">Neil:</span> <span data-sentence-id="1">Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English.</span> <span data-sentence-id="2">I'm Neil.</span></p>
        <p class="transcript-paragraph"><span class="speaker">Beth:</span> <span data-sentence-id="3">And I'm Beth.</span> <span data-sentence-id="4">In this programme, we're talking about politeness.</span> <span data-sentence-id="5">Britain has a <span class="glossary-term" data-word="reputation" data-context="default">reputation</span> for being a polite place where children are told to say 'please' and 'thank you', but in real life that isn't always true.</span> <span data-sentence-id="6">You, give me that pen!</span></p>
        <p class="transcript-paragraph"><span class="speaker">Neil:</span> <span data-sentence-id="7">I'm sorry.</span> <span data-sentence-id="8">That was a bit rude.</span></p>
        <p class="transcript-paragraph"><span class="speaker">Beth:</span> <span data-sentence-id="9">Well, what should I have said?</span></p>
        <p class="transcript-paragraph"><span class="speaker">Neil:</span> <span data-sentence-id="10">How about: "Neil, please could you pass me the pen?"</span></p>
        <p class="transcript-paragraph"><span class="speaker">Beth:</span> <span data-sentence-id="11">Fine.</span> <span data-sentence-id="12">Neil, could you please pass me the pen?</span></p>
        <p class="transcript-paragraph"><span class="speaker">Neil:</span> <span data-sentence-id="13">There you go!</span> <span data-sentence-id="14">That's much better.</span></p>
        <p class="transcript-paragraph"><span class="speaker">Beth:</span> <span data-sentence-id="15">Now listen as BBC Radio 4 <span class="glossary-term" data-word="presenter" data-context="default">presenter</span> Michael Rosen, who is a well-known poet and children's author in Britain, describes what happened to him one day:</span></p>
        <p class="transcript-paragraph"><span class="speaker">Michael Rosen:</span> <span data-sentence-id="16">Recently, this is how it went: a boy was walking past me in the street, stopped and said, "Hey! You're thingy, innit!"</span> <span data-sentence-id="17">Now, that one seems to break all the rules.</span> <span data-sentence-id="18">And because it broke the rules, it gave me a problem.</span> <span data-sentence-id="19">How do I answer it?</span></p>
        <p class="transcript-paragraph"><span class="speaker">Beth:</span> <span data-sentence-id="20">A boy saw Michael Rosen and said, "Hey! You're thingy, innit!"</span> <span data-sentence-id="21">He used the word thingy, because although he <span class="glossary-term" data-word="recognised" data-context="default">recognised</span> Michael, he couldn't remember his name.</span> <span data-sentence-id="22">He also said innit, which is short for 'isn't it', to emphasise what he'd said.</span></p>
        <p class="transcript-paragraph"><span class="speaker">Neil:</span> <span data-sentence-id="23">So, was the boy being impolite or was he just happy meeting a famous person in the street?</span> <span data-sentence-id="24">And why do we teach kids to be polite in the first place?</span> <span data-sentence-id="25">That's what we'll be discussing in this programme, using some useful new vocabulary.</span></p>
        <p class="transcript-paragraph"><span class="speaker">Beth:</span> <span data-sentence-id="26">But first, I have a question for you, Neil.</span> <span data-sentence-id="27">The British are well known for being polite, as we've said, and there's even an idiom we use in certain situations to remind someone to be especially polite.</span> <span data-sentence-id="28">But what is it?</span> <span data-sentence-id="29">Is it: a) mind your As and Bs, b) mind your Ps and Qs, or c) mind your Xs and Ys?</span></p>
        <p class="transcript-paragraph"><span class="speaker">Neil:</span> <span data-sentence-id="30">Well, I know the answer to this, but I'm going to say c) mind your Xs and Ys, because I think it's brilliant.</span></p>
        <p class="transcript-paragraph"><span class="speaker">Beth:</span> <span data-sentence-id="31">OK.</span> <span data-sentence-id="32">Interesting!</span> <span data-sentence-id="33">Well, we'll find out the correct answer later in the programme.</span> <span data-sentence-id="34">So, let's return to the boy who said, "Hey! You're thingy, innit!"</span> <span data-sentence-id="35">to famous poet Michael Rosen.</span> <span data-sentence-id="36">Was that impolite or not?</span> <span data-sentence-id="37">Professor Louise Mullany, who studies the language of politeness, has an answer.</span> <span data-sentence-id="38">She thinks that politeness is as much to do with the person being spoken to as the person speaking, as she explained to BBC Radio 4 programme, Word of Mouth:</span></p>
        <p class="transcript-paragraph"><span class="speaker">Louise Mullany:</span> <span data-sentence-id="39">I think the <span class="glossary-term" data-word="crucial" data-context="default">crucial</span> thing there is in how you've <span class="glossary-term" data-word="perceived" data-context="default">perceived</span> it.</span> <span data-sentence-id="40">So, obviously he's not giving us the <span class="glossary-term" data-word="conventional" data-context="default">conventional</span>: "Oh, good afternoon, Mr Rosen," or a more formal approach.</span> <span data-sentence-id="41">It's very, very informal… and he can't remember your name, and he's saying 'innit'.</span> <span data-sentence-id="42">Now, that has been <span class="glossary-term" data-word="interpreted" data-context="default">interpreted</span> by you as non-<span class="glossary-term" data-word="threatening" data-context="default">threatening</span> to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id="43">You don't see him as <span class="glossary-term" data-word="insulting" data-context="default">insulting</span> you, and you're actually <span class="glossary-term" data-word="quite" data-context="default">quite</span> <span class="glossary-term" data-word="kindly" data-context="default">kindly</span> disposed to that person.</span> <span data-sentence-id="44">So, you haven't interpreted it as offensive or <span class="glossary-term" data-word="aggressive" data-context="default">aggressive</span>.</span> <span data-sentence-id="45">You said – I think you described it as being quite <span class="glossary-term" data-word="civil" data-context="default">civil</span>, actually.</span></p>
        <p class="transcript-paragraph"><span class="speaker">Neil:</span> <span data-sentence-id="46">Michael Rosen didn't feel that the boy was insulting him.</span> <span data-sentence-id="47">To insult someone means to be rude or offensive to them.</span></p>
        <p class="transcript-paragraph"><span class="speaker">Beth:</span> <span data-sentence-id="48">Although his speech was very informal, Michael thought the boy was actually pleased to see him, not rude at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id="49">Micheal was well disposed to the boy – he liked and approved of him.</span></p>
        <p class="transcript-paragraph"><span class="speaker">Neil:</span> <span data-sentence-id="50">So, you could say that politeness is subjective; if Michael doesn't feel offended, then where is the <span class="glossary-term" data-word="offence" data-context="default">offence</span>?</span> <span data-sentence-id="51">Then why do we teach children to be polite at all?</span> <span data-sentence-id="52">Well, according to Professor Mullany, it's to do with the rules of <span class="glossary-term" data-word="society" data-context="default">society</span>.</span></p>
        <p class="transcript-paragraph"><span class="speaker">Beth:</span> <span data-sentence-id="53">That's right.</span> <span data-sentence-id="54">Louise thinks that by teaching our kids politeness they enjoy the benefits of being accepted in society.</span> <span data-sentence-id="55">So, imagine how embarrassed she felt when her two-year-old daughter <span class="glossary-term" data-word="repeatedly" data-context="default">repeatedly</span> ignored the cook at her nursery school and refused to say hello.</span> <span data-sentence-id="56">Here's Louise Mullany telling the story to BBC Radio 4's Word of Mouth:</span></p>
        <p class="transcript-paragraph"><span class="speaker">Louise Mullany:</span> <span data-sentence-id="57">The cook looked so disappointed.</span> <span data-sentence-id="58">And as I <span class="glossary-term" data-word="mention" data-context="default">mention</span> in the book, it felt to me like there were lots of other children skipping – skipping and jumping past going, "Hello!"</span> <span data-sentence-id="59">being really friendly children, and my daughter was just there.</span> <span data-sentence-id="60">And we started to make excuses for her, like, "Oh, she's tired. Oh, she's teething. She's this and she's that," because the <span class="glossary-term" data-word="embarrassment" data-context="default">embarrassment</span> was so <span class="glossary-term" data-word="strong" data-context="default">strong</span>.</span> <span data-sentence-id="61">And I felt awful walking back past the kitchen on my way out.</span> <span data-sentence-id="62">I was almost trying to hide my face, going, "I'm the one with the really rude child."</span></p>
        <p class="transcript-paragraph"><span class="speaker">Neil:</span> <span data-sentence-id="63">When her daughter didn't say hello to an adult, Louise made excuses for her.</span> <span data-sentence-id="64">If you make excuses for someone, you try to explain the reasons for their behaviour.</span> <span data-sentence-id="65">For example, Louise said her daughter was tired, she was growing new teeth, she was this and that.</span> <span data-sentence-id="66">The idiom this and that can be used to describe various unspecified things.</span> <span data-sentence-id="67">For example, if someone asks what you did this afternoon, you might reply, "Oh, not much. I stayed at home, I watched TV, I did this and that."</span></p>
        <p class="transcript-paragraph"><span class="speaker">Beth:</span> <span data-sentence-id="68">Politeness means different things to different people, but we still like it when people are polite to us, and I think the polite thing to do now is reveal the answer to my question, Neil.</span> <span data-sentence-id="69">So, the idiom that we use to remind someone to be polite is… not 'mind your Xs and Ys' – I'm sorry, Neil.</span> <span data-sentence-id="70">It's 'mind your Ps and Qs'.</span></p>
        <p class="transcript-paragraph"><span class="speaker">Neil:</span> <span data-sentence-id="71">That's a <span class="glossary-term" data-word="shame" data-context="default">shame</span>.</span> <span data-sentence-id="72">Xs and Ys is much better.</span></p>
        <p class="transcript-paragraph"><span class="speaker">Beth:</span> <span data-sentence-id="73">OK.</span> <span data-sentence-id="74">Now, let's recap the vocabulary we've learnt, starting with thingy, an informal word that's used if you can't remember someone's or something's name.</span> <span data-sentence-id="75">People also use the slang words, what's-his-name or what's-her-name, for the same reason.</span></p>
        <p class="transcript-paragraph"><span class="speaker">Neil:</span> <span data-sentence-id="76">Innit is a short form of the tag question, 'isn't it'.</span> <span data-sentence-id="77">It's used to add emphasis to a statement.</span></p>
        <p class="transcript-paragraph"><span class="speaker">Beth:</span> <span data-sentence-id="78">The adjective insulting means rude or offensive</span></p>
        <p class="transcript-paragraph"><span class="speaker">Neil:</span> <span data-sentence-id="79">If you are well disposed to someone, you like and approve of them.</span></p>
        <p class="transcript-paragraph"><span class="speaker">Beth:</span> <span data-sentence-id="80">When you make excuses for someone, you explain the reasons for their bad behaviour.</span></p>
        <p class="transcript-paragraph"><span class="speaker">Neil:</span> <span data-sentence-id="81">And finally, the idiom this and that describes various unspecified things.</span> <span data-sentence-id="82">Once again, our six minutes are up, but why not test yourself with the programme <span class="glossary-term" data-word="quiz" data-context="default">quiz</span> and <span class="glossary-term" data-word="worksheet" data-context="default">worksheet</span>, available now on our website bbclearningenglish.com.</span> <span data-sentence-id="83">Goodbye for now.</span></p>
        <p class="transcript-paragraph"><span class="speaker">Beth:</span> <span data-sentence-id="84">Bye!</span></p>
