00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:12,240
Hello, this is 6 Minute English
from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.

2
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,560
And I'm Beth.

3
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:16,720
In this programme,
we're talking about politeness.

4
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,000
Britain has a reputation
for being a polite place

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,320
where children are told to say please
and thank you,

6
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:26,600
but in real life
that isn't always true.

7
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,200
You, give me that pen!

8
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,160
I'm sorry.
That was a bit rude.

9
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,640
Well, what should I have said?

10
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:35,080
How about – Neil,
please could you pass me the pen?

11
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:37,960
Fine. Neil,
could you please pass me the pen?

12
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,400
There you go! That's much better.

13
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:45,000
Now listen, as BBC Radio 4 presenter
Michael Rosen, who is a well-known poet

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,120
and children's author in Britain,
describes what happened to him one day

15
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:51,440
Recently, this is how it went.

16
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:55,000
A boy was walking past me
in the street, stopped and said,

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,760
Hey, you're thingy, innit!

18
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,080
Now, that one seems to break
all the rules.

19
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:03,080
And because it broke the rules,
it gave me a problem.

20
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,800
How do I answer it?

21
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:09,440
A boy saw Michael Rosen and said,
Hey, you're thingy, innit!

22
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,000
He used the word, thingy,

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,360
because although he recognised Michael,
he couldn't remember his name.

24
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:20,800
He also said innit, which is short for
isn't it, to emphasise what he'd said.

25
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,800
So, was the boy being impolite

26
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:26,600
or was he just happy meeting
a famous person in the street?

27
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:29,600
And why do we teach kids to be polite
in the first place?

28
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,160
That's what we'll be discussing
in this programme,

29
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,240
using some useful new vocabulary.

30
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,800
But first,
I have a question for you, Neil.

31
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:40,240
The British are well known
for being polite, as we've said,

32
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:45,000
and there's even an idiom we use in
certain situations to remind someone

33
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,040
to be especially polite.

34
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,840
But what is it?

35
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:54,280
Is it: a) mind your As and Bs,
b) mind your Ps and Qs,

36
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:57,160
or c) mind your Xs and Ys?

37
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,280
Well, I know the answer to this,

38
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:04,560
but I'm going to say c) mind your Xs
and Ys, because I think it's brilliant.

39
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,680
OK. Interesting!

40
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:10,080
Well, we'll find out the correct
answer later in the programme.

41
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,240
So, let's return to the boy who said,
Hey, you're thingy innit!

42
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,680
to famous poet Michael Rosen.

43
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,880
Was that impolite or not?

44
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:22,800
Professor Louise Mullany, who studies
the language of politeness,

45
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,000
has an answer.

46
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,840
She thinks that politeness
is as much to do

47
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:30,360
with the person being spoken to
as the person speaking,

48
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:34,520
as she explained to BBC Radio 4
programme, Word of Mouth.

49
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:37,720
I think the crucial thing there is
in how you've perceived it.

50
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:40,840
So, obviously he's not giving us
the conventional,

51
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,560
Oh, good afternoon, Mr. Rosen,
or a more formal approach.

52
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,640
It's very, very informal...

53
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:48,080
and he can't remember your name,
and he's saying, innit!

54
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,280
Now, that has been interpreted by you
as non-threatening to you.

55
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,560
You don't see him as insulting you,

56
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,320
and you're actually
quite kindly disposed to that person.

57
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:00,200
So, you haven't interpreted it
as offensive or aggressive.

58
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:03,240
You said – I think you described it
as being quite civil, actually.

59
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:06,440
Michael Rosen didn't feel
that the boy was insulting him.

60
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:09,880
To insult someone means to be rude
or offensive to them.

61
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:12,480
Although his speech was
very informal,

62
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,760
Michael thought the boy was actually
pleased to see him, not rude at all.

63
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:21,520
Michael was well disposed to the boy –
he liked and approved of him.

64
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:24,760
So, you could say
that politeness is subjective.

65
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:28,200
If Michael doesn't feel offended,
then where is the offence?

66
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,080
Then why do we teach children
to be polite at all?

67
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:35,640
Well, according to Professor Mulaney,
it's to do with the rules of society.

68
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:39,640
That's right. Louise thinks that
by teaching our kids politeness,

69
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:43,680
they enjoy the benefits
of being accepted in society.

70
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,880
So, imagine how embarrassed she felt
when her two-year-old daughter

71
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:54,040
repeatedly ignored the cook at her
nursery school and refused to say hello.

72
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:59,280
Here's Louise Melanie telling the
story to BBC Radio 4's Word of Mouth.

73
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,360
The cook looked so disappointed.

74
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,800
And as I mention in the book,
it felt to me like there were lots

75
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:07,480
of other children skipping – skipping
and jumping past going hello,

76
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:10,760
being really friendly children,
and my daughter was just there.

77
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:13,960
And we started to make excuses
for her like – Oh, she's tired.

78
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,880
Oh, she's teething.
She's this and she's that.

79
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,600
Because the embarrassment was
so strong.

80
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,480
And I felt awful walking back
past the kitchen on my way out.

81
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,920
I was almost trying
to hide my face, going –

82
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,600
I'm the one
with the really rude child.

83
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:30,680
When her daughter didn't say hello to
an adult, Louise made excuses for her.

84
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,440
If you make excuses for someone,

85
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:35,360
you try to explain the reasons
for their behaviour.

86
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,200
For example,
Louise said her daughter was tired,

87
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:41,280
she was growing new teeth,
she was this and that.

88
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:45,600
The idiom, this and that, can be used
to describe various unspecified things.

89
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,360
For example, if someone asks
what you did this afternoon,

90
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,280
you might reply – Oh, not much.

91
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:53,160
I stayed at home,
I watched TV, I did this and that.

92
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:56,160
Politeness means different things
to different people,

93
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,960
but we still like it when
people are polite to us, and I think

94
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:04,840
the polite thing to do now is reveal
the answer to my question, Neil.

95
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:10,320
So, the idiom that we use
to remind someone to be polite is...

96
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,240
not mind your Xs and Ys –
I'm sorry, Neil.

97
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,920
It's mind your Ps and Qs.

98
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:18,160
That's a shame.
Xs and Ys is much better.

99
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,360
OK. Now, let's recap the vocabulary
we've learnt,

100
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,760
starting with 'thingy',
an informal word that's used

101
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:28,800
if you can't remember
someone's or something's name.

102
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,080
People also use the slang words,
'what's-his-name' or 'what's-her-name',

103
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,640
for the same reason.

104
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:37,720
'Innit' is a short form
of the tag question, isn't it.

105
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,240
It's used to add emphasis
to a statement.

106
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,000
The adjective 'insulting' means rude
or offensive.

107
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,920
If you are well disposed to someone
you like and approve of them.

108
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,120
When you make excuses for someone,

109
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:53,000
you explain the reasons
for their bad behaviour.

110
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,400
And finally, the idiom 'this and that'
describes various unspecified things.

111
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,960
Once again, our six minutes are up,

112
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:03,040
but why not test yourself with
the programme quiz and worksheet,

113
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:06,480
available now on our website
bbclearningenglish.com.

114
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,280
Goodbye for now.
Bye!
